# **Target Strike**
Target Strike is the fifth project I developed as part of the "Unity Learn Junior Programmer" program. This game was created to enhance my skills. In the project, balls are launched from a certain position at specific intervals. These balls include good balls and a bad bomb. When the player clicks on the good balls with the mouse, each ball has its own points, and the player earns points accordingly. However, if the player clicks on the bomb, their points decrease.

## **How to Play**
### Basic Features
* The game includes both good balls and a bad bomb, which affect the player's score by increasing or decreasing it.
* When balls and bombs explode, an effect is created, adding more dynamism to the game.
* If a ball hits the target area, the game is over, and the player can restart the game.
* The game features difficulty levels (easy-medium-hard).
### The Project Includes the Following Additional Features:
* Initially, the game would end immediately when a single good ball hit the ground. To prevent the game from ending too quickly, lives were added. The number of lives is set to 3.
* To make the game more lively, music was added. However, considering that some players might be disturbed by the music, a slider was added to adjust the music settings.
* Pressing the "A" key allows the player to toggle the pause feature on and off.

This project was originally developed in 2024. It appears at the top of my GitHub profile because I have recently transferred and reorganized my older projects into my new GitHub account.
